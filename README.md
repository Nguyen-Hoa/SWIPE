Smarter Watering with Image Processing and Evapotranspiration

EECS280 Project

Abstract (incomplete): Evapotranspiration (ET) is a widely used metric 
for estimating 
plant moisture. A popular application of ET is in irrigation scheduling, 
where water consumption is minimized while keeping plants at a desired 
level.
